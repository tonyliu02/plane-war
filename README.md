# plane-war

It is a plane war game built using Python, specifically pygame. This repository consists of the source files and resources (pictures, sounds, etc.), and an executable file that is intended for users who do not have Python installed. In the game, the user could move the planes around by using either the arrow keys or keys A (left), S (down), D (right), and W (up). Users could also use the Space bar to kill all the enemies appearing on the screen. 

The difficulty of the game would increase as time goes on.

Once in a while, supplies (extra life and double bullet) would be dropped off. The extra life would only take effect if the current number of lives is less than three. In other words, the maximum number of lives is always three. Once three lives are used up due to the collisions between the plane and the enemies, the game would be over, and the user could choose to start again or end the game.
